Author: Martijn Tennekes and Edwin de Jonge
Description: A tableplot is a visualisation of a (large)
    dataset with a dozen of variables, both numeric and
    categorical. Each column represents a variable and each
    row bin is an aggregate of a certain number of records.
    Numeric variables are visualized as bar charts, and
    categorical variables as stacked bar charts. Missing
    values are taken into account. Also supports large ffdf
    datasets from the ff package.
