Title: Tableplot, a visualization of large statistical datasets
Type: Package
LazyLoad: yes
Author: Martijn Tennekes and Edwin de Jonge
Description: A tableplot is a visualisation of a (large) statistical
    dataset with a dozen of variables, both both numeric and
    categorical. Each column represents a variable and each row bin is
    an aggregate of a certain number of records. Numeric variables are
    visualized as bar charts, and categorical variables as stacked bar
    charts. Missing values are taken into account. A GUI has been
    implemented which is used to easily customize the tableplot. Also
    supports large ffdf datasets from the ff package.
